# Overview

This is my capstone project for Flatiron school.
The capstone utilizes 3 git repos for deploying 3 microservices to display a React Frontend.
The rest of this README details my work and what I did.

## Setup Git repo

* Create repo on Github
* `git clone` the repo
* `git checkout -b develop` to create a new branch named "develop"
* Fork all of the repos provided by Flatiron to personal Github
    * This is so I can edit the code on my own if desired
* Use [Git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) to pull in the three forked repos
    * `git submodule add "URL"`
    * If looking to clone this from scratch, need to run the following:
        * `git submodule init`
        * `git submodule update`
    * In order to update the submodules:
        * cd to the directory the submodule corresponds to
        * `git fetch`
        * Changes are now available locally


## Create Dockerfile for aggregatorService

* Create a Dockerfile in the aggregatorService directory for golang
* Just go look at it, don't want to spend time detailing how to make Dockerfiles for go.
    * I put comments into the Dockerfile even.
* Of note is that the go service defaults to port 7777.
* Verify the Dockerfile works:
    * `docker build -t aggregatorservice:1.0 .`
    * `docker run --rm -p 7777:7777 aggregatorservice:1.0`
    * `curl localhost:7777/ping`
    * Should receive a JSON detailing status: OK
